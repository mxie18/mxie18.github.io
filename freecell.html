            This picture is a good illustration of how our GUI was designed. To
            quickly break it down, we have a typical toolbar at the top in which
            every command can be executed. We then have a pane called current
            which displays the current layer of the image. The effects panel on
            the left applies an effect to the current layer. The right panel
            holds all the layers of an image and shows which layers are
            visible/invisible. Lastly, we have a log on the bottom which logs
            user action.

            For a more detailed explanation of every piece of functionality, see
            the USEME file linked below.
